# Power BI Report Planning Skill

This skill orchestrates the full lifecycle for a new Power BI report:

**Define -> Inspect -> Spec -> Approve -> Build -> Validate -> Publish**

It is intentionally broader than a pure requirements-gathering flow: it captures
the report spec **and** continues into implementation after the user approves.

## Must/Prefer/Avoid

### MUST

- Use this skill for broad report creation workflows that need requirements, dependency checks, approval, and build sequencing.
- Ask focused clarification questions one at a time and stop after the required decision is clear.
- Lock `_brief/report-spec.md` and get approval before implementation.
- Route design decisions through `powerbi-report-design` and file mechanics through `powerbi-report-authoring`.

### PREFER

- Infer obvious answers from the prompt, model, existing PBIP files, or earlier rounds instead of re-asking.
- Inspect the semantic model before finalizing page scope or visual recommendations.
- Treat publishing as optional and only proceed when approved.

### AVOID

- Do not use this skill for small, surgical edits to existing PBIR files.
- Do not build before the user approves the locked report spec.
- Do not duplicate detailed visual-design or PBIR-authoring guidance that belongs to companion skills.

## Examples of When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to create a new Power BI report and needs
both:

1. A guided requirements workflow.
2. A path to implementation after approval.

Examples:

- "Let's create a new Power BI report from this semantic model."
- "Help me define and then build a Power BI report."
- "Use the report playbook to start a new report."
- "Create a reusable workflow for new Power BI reports."

Do **not** use this skill for a small edit to an existing report page. For
direct PBIR authoring tasks, use `powerbi-report-authoring`. For visual critique or
greenfield design guidance **without the full guided workflow** (a one-off
"redesign this" or "what should this look like?"), use
`powerbi-report-design` directly. This skill *uses* the design skill during
Rounds 3–4 — it does not replace it.

## Required Operating Rules

1. **Ask one question at a time.** Use `ask_user` for each clarification.
2. **Run 3-5 clarification rounds maximum.** Each round may have one primary
   question and, only if absolutely necessary, one follow-up.
3. **Inspect the semantic model before locking the spec.** Use the semantic
   model skill or an MCP server when available; otherwise inspect local
   TMDL/PBIP files directly.
4. **Check dependencies explicitly.** Do not assume Desktop, MCP, authoring, or
   Fabric publishing are available.
5. **Produce one locked `_brief/report-spec.md` before building.**
6. **Ask for approval before implementation.** Do not build until the user
   explicitly approves.
7. **When approved, build end-to-end.** Model changes, PBIR generation,
   validation, Desktop preview, screenshot loop, and optional Fabric publish.
8. **Local edits stay local unless publishing is approved.**
9. **Do not re-ask known answers.** If the original prompt, inspected files, or
   a prior round already provides audience, page count, delivery target, scope,
   or design direction, capture it in working notes and move on. Ask only for
   genuine ambiguity or risky tradeoffs.

## Dependency Checklist

Before implementation, capture this status:

| Dependency | Purpose | Required When |
|---|---|---|
| Power BI Desktop | Open/reload PBIP and visually validate report | Always for local preview |
| PBIP/PBIR project | File-based report authoring | Always for generated reports |
| TMDL semantic model | Model persistence and source control | Required for model edits |
| `powerbi-modeling-mcp` | Inspect tables, columns, measures; create measures/columns; deploy semantic model | Required for live model authoring |
| `powerbi-report-authoring` skill | Validate PBIR, reload Desktop, screenshot pages | Required for report authoring validation |
| `powerbi-report-management` skill | Create/update/download Fabric reports | Required only for Fabric publishing |
| Node.js | Generator-based PBIR authoring | Recommended for reproducible reports |

If a dependency is unavailable, continue planning and mark the affected phase as
blocked/manual. Do not pretend it is available.

## Round Structure

### Round 0 — Setup and Dependency Check

Goal: identify the semantic model, report target, and available tooling.

Ask only what cannot be inspected automatically:

> What semantic model or dataset should this report use?

Recommended choices should be concrete if candidates are discoverable. Enumerate
existing Fabric semantic models and local `.SemanticModel` folders in scope,
then present them as options and mark the best match as recommended. Example:

- `<DiscoveredSemanticModelName>` (Recommended)
- Another existing Fabric semantic model
- A new local dataset

Then inspect/check:

- Existing `.pbip`, `.Report`, `.SemanticModel` folders.
- Whether TMDL files exist.
- Whether Power BI Desktop automation script exists.
- Whether MCP connection is available or can be established.
- Whether Fabric publishing is requested.

Output working notes:

```markdown
Dependency status:
- Semantic model:
- PBIP/PBIR:
- Desktop preview:
- Modeling MCP:
- Report-authoring skill:
- Fabric publishing:
- Node generator:
```

### Round 1 — Audience and Job

Goal: understand who the report is for and what decision/job it supports.

If both audience and job-to-be-done are already clear from the prompt, summarize
the inferred answer instead of asking. Otherwise ask for the missing piece(s),
one at a time.

Ask when audience is unclear:

> Who is this report primarily for?

Recommended choices:

1. Executives / leadership — concise KPIs, trends, risks, decisions
2. Analysts — exploration, drilldowns, comparisons, tables
3. Operators — monitoring, exceptions, status, action queues
4. External audience — polished story, guided narrative, minimal slicers
5. Enthusiasts / fans — magazine-style narrative, rich visuals, rankings

Then ask only if the job-to-be-done is still unclear:

> What should the report help them do?

Recommended choices:

1. Understand the overall story
2. Track performance
3. Find outliers or opportunities
4. Compare entities or segments
5. Explore individual records/profiles
6. Prepare for a recurring business review

Capture:

```markdown
Audience:
Primary purpose:
Tone:
Success criteria:
```

### Round 2 — Model Inventory and Scope

Goal: inspect the model and define the first-build scope boundary without
re-asking for scope the user already gave.

Use whatever model-inspection capability is available — pick the first that
applies, in order of preference:

1. A semantic-model authoring skill, if installed.
2. A modeling MCP server (e.g., `powerbi-modeling-mcp-*`) — connect to the
   live model, list tables/columns/measures/relationships, and run DAX for
   live validation.
3. Direct reads of local TMDL files (`definition/model.tmdl`,
   `definition/tables/*.tmdl`, `definition/relationships.tmdl`) when no live
   connection is available.

Do not hardcode tool names in user-facing prompts — describe the inspection
intent and let the agent pick the available tool.

Summarize:

```markdown
Facts:
- table, grain, keys, useful measures

Dimensions:
- date/time, geography, entity, category, owner, status, segment

Existing measures:
- core available measures

Likely missing model work:
- measures
- calculated columns
- relationship fixes
- sort columns
- helper fields for slicers/search

Risks:
- nulls/sparsity
- inactive relationships
- high-cardinality slicers
- fields that will not filter as expected
```

After inspection, infer the first-build scope from the original request and
prior answers. Do not ask a standalone scope question if the user already gave a
page count, report type, or content boundary (for example, "build a 4 page
dashboard"). Instead, summarize the boundary in working notes:

```markdown
First-build scope:
- <focused first build / standard report / operational app / narrative report>
- inferred from: <user prompt | prior answer | model shape>
- included now:
- deferred:
```

Ask a scope question only when the boundary is unclear, too broad, or risky. If
asking, present tailored choices from the inspected model rather than generic
first-build options. Example:

> The model supports sales, products, geography, discounts, and profitability.
> For this first build, should we keep it focused on executive performance, or
> include a deeper product/customer exploration too?

### Round 3 — Narrative and Page Plan

Goal: turn the model and scope into page architecture.

Invoke or explicitly consult `powerbi-report-design` for page-level archetype
routing and composition guidance. The design skill owns visual routing; do not
duplicate its routing table here. Use the data shape from Round 2 to surface
2-3 report shape options for user sign-off.

The five archetypes the design skill ships are: **Executive Summary**,
**Operational Monitor**, **Analytical Canvas**, **Narrative Story**,
**Comparative Benchmark**. Use the design skill's archetype and composition
guidance for layout variants, multi-archetype reports, and cross-page variant
rotation.

Ask only after applying the inferred first-build scope from Round 2:

> Which report shape should we use?

Present 2–3 named compositions (e.g., *Executive landing + Analytical
exploration + Comparative ranking* for a multi-domain ask, or *Single
executive landing* for a focused ask). Recommend one based on Rounds 1–2
and mark it `(Recommended)`.

Draft page list in the answer after the user chooses:

```markdown
Proposed pages:
1. <Page> — archetype — purpose — core visuals — fields/measures
2. <Page> — archetype — purpose — core visuals — fields/measures
<repeat for each approved page>
```

Capture slicers and interactions:

- Global slicers
- Page-specific slicers
- Search/prefix slicers for high-cardinality dimensions
- Drillthrough/profile pages
- Bookmarks/navigation if needed

### Round 4 — Design Identity, Accessibility, and Delivery

Goal: lock the design identity, accessibility baseline, and delivery target.

Invoke or explicitly consult `powerbi-report-design` for design identity and
theme direction. Design identity (tone + signature) is owned by the design skill
— do not invent a parallel vocabulary here. Use the design skill's identity
guidance to pick a tone+signature combination, then surface it to the user.

Ask:

> What should this report feel like?

Present 2–3 concrete identity options adapted to the audience and domain from
Rounds 1–2. Each option names a report feel and the one signature visual move
it implies. Recommend one and mark it `(Recommended)`.

If the user has brand guidelines, make one option brand-forward rather than
picking a generic tone.

Then ask delivery only if unclear:

> Where should the finished report end up?

Recommended choices:

1. Local PBIP only first
2. Publish to an existing Fabric workspace
3. Create new semantic model + report in Fabric
4. Update an existing Fabric report
5. Build local first, decide publishing later

Design defaults (these come from the design skill's gotchas + base theme;
applied automatically unless the user overrides):

- Use accessible contrast (WCAG AA minimum on every text/background pair).
- Avoid red-on-red and low-contrast palettes.
- Prefer Azure Map over deprecated map/filledMap visuals.
- Add alt text to every chart.
- Use searchable dropdown slicers for high-cardinality fields.
- Use tile/list slicers only for short categorical fields.
- Place detailed tables near the bottom of the page.
- Keep report interactions predictable and consistent.

## Design Contract Gate

Before producing `_brief/report-spec.md` for approval, get a canonical
`Design Brief:` YAML block from `powerbi-report-design`. The planner may provide
requirements, model inventory, page goals, and user constraints to the design
skill, but the planner must not author a competing detailed design skeleton.

The canonical design block must include:

- `generated_by: powerbi-report-design`
- `contract_version`
- one `pages[]` entry for every page in the page plan
- `pages[].layout_contract.canvas`
- `pages[].layout_contract.grid.regions`
- `pages[].layout_contract.placements`
- `pages[].layout_contract.space_audit`
- one `page_title` textbox placement with non-empty title text per page
- slicer placements in a top-right `filters` region or a justified filter rail
- no bare single-value `cardVisual` occupying the largest/dominant hero region
  unless the design marks it as a composite KPI treatment with context and
  rationale
- no unresolved placeholders, ellipses, or prose-only wireframes

If the block is missing these items, stop and revise the design contract before
asking for approval or invoking `powerbi-report-authoring`.

## Locked Report Spec Output

After Rounds 0-4, produce one file and save it under `./_brief/` in the
current working directory:

- `./_brief/report-spec.md` — the single source of truth for approval and
  implementation handoff.

`report-spec.md` has two layers:

1. **Markdown sections** for user approval and readable context.
2. A fenced `yaml` block containing the exact `Design Brief:` returned by
   `powerbi-report-design` — the canonical implementation contract that
   `powerbi-report-authoring` consumes.

If Markdown prose and the embedded YAML disagree, fix `report-spec.md` before
building. Do not ask the authoring agent to choose between conflicting
instructions.

If the agent runtime exposes a dedicated session/scratch folder (for example a
`session-state` path injected by the harness), you may also write a copy there
for user visibility, but the canonical implementation handoff file remains
`./_brief/report-spec.md` unless every later authoring step carries the alternate
absolute path explicitly.

### `report-spec.md` template

The user-approval doc and agent handoff contract. The Markdown captures
sign-off granularity; the embedded YAML captures exact implementation intent.

# Report Spec

## Report identity
- Report name:
- Semantic model:
- Audience:
- Primary purpose:
- Delivery target:

## User decisions and constraints
- Scope:
- Page count:
- Interactivity:
- Design direction:
- Publishing:
- Tooling:
- Model edit permissions:
- Accessibility:
- Data caveats:

## Narrative
- Core story:
- Audience promise:
- Key questions answered:

## Design identity (from `powerbi-report-design` Step 1)
- Tone: <named entry from tone-catalog, e.g. "Editorial Newsroom">
- Signature: <one defining move, e.g. "tabular numerals + display serif headlines">
- Brownfield delta (if applicable): <current_tone → target_tone>

## Page plan (archetypes from `powerbi-report-design` Step 3)
1. Page name
   - Archetype:                      <Executive Summary | Analytical Canvas | …>
   - Layout variant (A/B/C):         <plus one-sentence variant_rationale>
   - Purpose:
   - Visuals:
   - Fields/measures:
   - Slicers/interactions:

## Design system summary
- Theme name + base palette (1–2 lines):
- Color semantics (which measure → which color, 1–2 lines):
- Typography pairing (display + body):
- Layout pattern (grid + gutter + density):
- Accessibility commitments:

## Model requirements
- Existing measures:
- New measures:
- New calculated columns:
- Relationship/sort requirements:

## Canonical design contract

Paste the exact fenced `yaml` block produced by `powerbi-report-design` here.
Do not rewrite it from planner memory and do not replace its mechanical
`layout_contract` with a freeform ASCII wireframe.

The YAML block is authoritative for implementation. `powerbi-report-authoring`
must implement this block; surrounding prose is context and conflict detection.

## Implementation notes

- Model changes:
- PBIR/report authoring:
- Validation:
- Desktop screenshot verification:
- Publishing boundary:
- Risks:
````

### Required acceptance checks before approval

Before writing the approval question, verify the spec meets all of the
following. If any check fails, fix `report-spec.md` and the embedded
`Design Brief:` block before asking for approval.

- The block begins with `Design Brief:`.
- It includes `generated_by: powerbi-report-design` and `contract_version`.
- Every Markdown page has a matching `pages[]` entry.
- Every page has `layout_contract.canvas`, `layout_contract.grid.regions`, and
  `layout_contract.placements`.
- Every page has `layout_contract.space_audit` with empty `unplaced_regions`
  and an explicit empty-space/balance rationale.
- Every page has a `page_title` textbox placement with non-empty title text.
- Slicers are in a top-right `filters` region or a justified filter rail; no
  data visual starts under a slicer/header-band region.
- No bare single-value `cardVisual` is the largest/dominant hero region unless
  the YAML explicitly describes a composite KPI treatment with context.
- The approved YAML has no ellipses (`...`), unresolved placeholders, or
  pages/visuals promised in Markdown but omitted from the YAML.

## Approval Gate

After writing `report-spec.md`, ask exactly one approval question:

> Approve this report spec so I can start building?

Recommended choices:

1. Approve — start building
2. Revise audience/purpose
3. Revise scope/page plan
4. Revise design/delivery

Do not invoke authoring or publishing skills until the user approves.

## Implementation After Approval

When the user approves, execute this sequence:

1. Re-read the approved canonical report spec (normally `_brief/report-spec.md`,
   or the explicitly carried alternate absolute path) and extract the embedded
   `Design Brief:` YAML block. Verify it has `generated_by:
   powerbi-report-design`, `contract_version`, one populated `layout_contract`
   per page, and `space_audit` per page before authoring. For greenfield, verify
   the canvas is FHD (`1920 x 1080`) unless the user chose another size, and
   verify the largest/dominant region is not a bare single-value `cardVisual`.
2. Mark the first implementation todo as in progress.
3. Connect to the semantic model.
4. Create/update required measures and calculated columns using whichever
   model-authoring path is available — a semantic-model authoring skill, a modeling
   MCP server, or direct TMDL edits — in that order of preference.
5. Validate each model change with DAX where possible.
6. After calculated-column or measure changes, trigger the lightweight
   recalculation supported by the chosen tool (e.g., XMLA refresh with
   `refreshType=Calculate`) unless a full source refresh is explicitly
   required and safe.
7. Export model changes to TMDL.
8. If the export writes a flat TMDL layout, reorganize into
   `definition/database.tmdl`, `definition/model.tmdl`,
   `definition/relationships.tmdl`, and `definition/tables/*.tmdl`.
9. Scaffold or copy the PBIP/PBIR report structure.
10. Author PBIR through `powerbi-report-authoring` guidance.
11. Generate report files.
12. Validate required files and JSON.
13. Open/reload in Power BI Desktop.
14. Screenshot pages.
15. Fix visual, slicer, data-binding, accessibility, and layout issues.
16. Publish only if the approved delivery target includes publishing.

## Fabric Publish Rules

Publish only when the approved delivery target includes publishing. Hand the
publish step to `powerbi-report-management`; do not author Fabric REST calls
or `definition.pbir` `byConnection` payloads from this skill. See
`powerbi-report-management` for the authoritative `byConnection` schemas
(minimal API form and full XMLA form for local Desktop validation), LRO
polling, and theme upload rules.

Planner-level rules to respect when invoking `powerbi-report-management`:

- Resolve workspace, report, and semantic model dynamically; do not hardcode
  IDs.
- Include all PBIR definition parts on create/update; never send a partial
  definition.
- Match custom theme upload paths exactly to the paths referenced in
  `report.json`.
- Use `--verbose` for long-running operations and poll LROs to a terminal
  state (`Succeeded` / `Failed`).
- Clean up any temporary publish scripts or payload files after the operation
  completes.

## Validation Standards

A report is not complete until:

- Required PBIP/PBIR files exist.
- All JSON parses.
- `definition.pbir` points to the expected semantic model.
- Pages and visuals are generated in expected counts.
- Power BI Desktop opens the `.pbip`.
- Desktop reload succeeds.
- Screenshot capture succeeds for at least the cover and any newly authored
  pages.
- If published, Fabric LRO returns `Succeeded`.

## Anti-Patterns and Pitfalls

- Generated PBIR is safer than hand-editing individual visual JSON files.
- Model changes must be persisted before Desktop reload.
- DAX filter direction can break dimension aggregations from fact-side flags.
- High-cardinality slicers need search or prefix filtering.
- Desktop validation catches issues that JSON validation cannot.
- Fabric publishing is sensitive to `byConnection` schema and theme paths.
