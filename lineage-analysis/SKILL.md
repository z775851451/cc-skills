# Lineage Analysis

Trace downstream dependencies from a semantic model to all connected reports across the tenant. No admin permissions required -- workspace contributor access is sufficient.

## When to Use

- Before modifying or deleting a semantic model, to understand impact
- Auditing which reports are connected to a model and where they live
- Identifying orphaned or test reports connected to production models
- Cross-workspace dependency mapping

## Downstream Reports

Run `scripts/get-downstream-reports.py` to find all reports bound to a semantic model.

```bash
# By workspace and model name
python3 scripts/get-downstream-reports.py "Workspace Name" "Model Name"

# By dataset GUID directly
python3 scripts/get-downstream-reports.py --dataset-id <guid>

# JSON output for further processing
python3 scripts/get-downstream-reports.py "Workspace" "Model" --json
```

**Requirements:** `azure-identity`, `requests` (`pip install azure-identity requests`). Authenticated via `DefaultAzureCredential` (works with `az login`, managed identity, or environment variables).

**How it works:** Lists all workspaces the user can access, then queries each workspace's reports in parallel (8 workers) checking `datasetId`. Groups results by workspace. Typically completes in under 10 seconds for ~100 workspaces.

**Permissions:** Workspace contributor or higher on any workspace to be scanned. Reports in workspaces without access will not appear. For full tenant coverage, use the `--dataset-id` flag with a tenant admin token and the `admin/reports` API instead.

## Limitations

**Reports are not the only consumers.** A semantic model can also be consumed by:
- Analyze in Excel workbooks (.xlsx live connections)
- Composite models (other semantic models chaining via DirectQuery)
- Explorations (ad-hoc visual explorations in the Power BI service)
- Fabric notebooks (connecting via Spark or sempy)
- Fabric data agents
- Paginated reports (.rdl)
- Dataflows referencing the model
- Third-party tools connecting via XMLA

The script only discovers Power BI reports. For full dependency mapping including these other item types, use the Fabric lineage APIs (`fab api "admin/groups/{id}/lineage"`) or the lineage view in the Power BI service UI.

**Not appropriate for many models at once.** The script scans all accessible workspaces per invocation. Running it in a loop over dozens of semantic models will generate excessive API calls and risk throttling. For bulk inventory across many models, use the admin scan API (`fab api "admin/workspaces/getInfo"`) when tenant-admin access is available, or the cross-workspace catalog via `fab find ... -P type=SemanticModel` for a quick non-admin list. Neither alternative resolves report-to-model dependency edges; `fab find` and the OneLake catalog do not expose lineage. For that you still need either a per-workspace scan (this script's approach) or the official Power BI lineage admin API at `fab api "admin/groups/{ws-id}/lineage"`.

## Interpreting Results

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Report format `PBIR` | Modern format, editable as JSON |
| Report format `PBIRLegacy` | Legacy format, needs conversion to PBIR for direct editing |
| Reports in unexpected workspaces | May indicate copies, forks, or thin reports pointing at a shared model |
| Many downstream reports | High-impact model -- changes require coordination |
