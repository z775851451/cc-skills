# TMDL Authoring

Expert guidance for authoring and editing TMDL (Tabular Model Definition Language) files directly in PBIP projects.

> **This skill is a last resort.** Direct TMDL file editing lacks the validation, atomicity, and DAX query capabilities of the Tabular Editor CLI, Power BI MCP server, or the `connect-pbid` skill (TOM via PowerShell). Use those tools when available. TMDL editing is appropriate when:
>
> - Working with PBIP files in a Git repo without Power BI Desktop open
> - No Tabular Editor CLI or MCP server is installed
> - Making quick text-level fixes (descriptions, format strings, display folders) where a full tool chain is overkill
>
> Direct TMDL editing does not validate DAX syntax, check referential integrity, or verify that property values are valid. Errors will only surface when the model is next loaded in Power BI Desktop or deployed via XMLA. Use the **`pbip-validator`** agent to check TMDL files for syntax issues, indentation errors, and referential integrity before opening in PBI Desktop.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate only when the Tabular Editor CLI, Power BI MCP server, or `connect-pbid` skill are not available, and tasks involve:

- Editing `.tmdl` files directly (measures, columns, tables, relationships)
- Adding or modifying measure definitions in TMDL
- Adding descriptions to columns, measures, or tables
- Fixing `summarizeBy` or `formatString` values
- Understanding TMDL syntax rules (indentation, quoting, property ordering)
- Writing multi-line DAX in TMDL format
- Understanding the difference between `///` descriptions and `//` comments

## Critical

- **`///` (triple-slash) sets the `Description` property** on the object that immediately follows it. A `///` line must be immediately followed by a declaration (`measure`, `column`, `table`, etc.); never by a blank line or another `///`. Use `//` for regular comments.
- **Indentation is semantic.** TMDL uses whitespace indentation where depth equals nesting level ([TMDL spec — Indentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tmdl/tmdl-overview#indentation)). PBIP files use a single tab per level because Power BI Desktop and the TOM `TmdlSerializer` default to `IndentationMode.Tabs`. Spaces are also valid (`IndentationMode.Spaces`, default 4 per level), but be consistent within a file; mixed or incorrect indentation will break the model. Properties of a table are indented one level; properties of a column (which belongs to a table) are indented two levels.
- **Name quoting rules:** Only quote names that contain spaces, special characters, or start with a digit. Simple names and underscore-prefixed names are unquoted. See the Name Quoting section for details.
- **M expressions and tables share a namespace.** A name declared by `expression <name>` in `expressions.tmdl` and a name declared by `table <name>` in `tables/*.tmdl` collide; Power BI Desktop fails the load with `'duplicate member <name>'`. Pick distinct names; the conventional fix is to suffix the M expression with ` Query` or ` Source` and have partitions reference it via `source = #"<Name> Query"`. `validate_pbip.py` enforces this as an ERROR.
- **`File.Contents` relative paths resolve from the model root (`<Name>.SemanticModel/`), NOT from the .tmdl file location.** A partition in `definition/database/Sales.tmdl` pointing at `File.Contents("../../../data/Sales.csv")` resolves to the project root's parent and fails. The correct depth is `../../data/Sales.csv` (two `..`). Verify by opening the partition in Power BI Desktop's PQ editor; the error message names the resolved path. See `references/greenfield-scaffolding.md` §4 for full path math and an off-by-one pitfall example.
- **`database.tmdl` is the *root* file of the SemanticModel — its content is `database <Name>` + `compatibilityLevel:` + `culture:`, NOT `ref table` / `ref defaultMeasure` / `createOrReplace`.** The `model.tmdl` file holds `ref table` entries and `defaultMeasure:` / `defaultMeasureTable:`. Putting either of those in `database.tmdl` fails with `UnsupportedObjectType`. Confirmed against PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` parser — it reports the exact unsupported property and line number, so use that as the diagnostic tool.
- **Per-table `.tmdl` files start with `table <Name>`, not a `createOrReplace` wrapper.** `createOrReplace` is only valid in the *body* of an object (e.g. inside a `partition` `source =` block, or in a top-level `function` body). Wrapping the entire table in `createOrReplace` → `table` produces `UnsupportedObjectType - createOrReplace is not a supported property in the current context!`.
- **Date table marking uses two annotations on the Date table file, NOT `dataCategory: PaddedDateTable`.** Correct form: `annotation PBI_ProTip_MarkAsDateTable = """{"minDate":"...","maxDate":"..."}"""` plus `annotation PBI_ProTip_MarkAsDateTableColumn = "<ColumnName>"`. The `dataCategory` keyword is for other semantic tags (e.g. `PaddedDateTable` is not a valid `dataCategory` value in the current parser).
- **PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` expects `model.tmdl` at the `<Name>.SemanticModel/` root, NOT inside `definition/`.** When the path is wrong the parser reports `Invalid indentation` against `./model` (line 3) — the error refers to a file the parser expects at the model root. Move `model.tmdl` up one level (`mv <Name>.SemanticModel/model.tmdl <Name>.SemanticModel/../model.tmdl`) and retry. `database.tmdl` and `tables/*.tmdl` stay under `definition/`. `model.tmdl` does not.
- **PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` rejects `model.tmdl` written as JSON.** The minimum body is `model <Name>` + properties on indented lines (TAB per level). A JSON-shaped `model.tmdl` (with `{ "name": ..., "compatibilityLevel": ... }`) reports `Indentation` errors. Same for `database.tmdl` — minimum body is `database <Name>` + `compatibilityLevel:` + `culture:`, no JSON, no `ref table` / `ref defaultMeasure` (those fail with `UnsupportedObjectType`).
- **Cross-year week keys (`YYYY-WW`) must declare `sortByColumn: <DateColumn>`.** Lexical order puts `2026-W52` after `2027-W08` (`'2' < '2'` true, then `'6' > '0'`) — slicers and trend X-axes will sort weeks wrong, putting the year boundary mid-list. Always sort the string week column by its underlying Monday date column:
  ```tmdl
  column WeekKey
      dataType: string
      sourceColumn: WeekKey
      sortByColumn: WeekStart   // <-- forces date-based sort across year boundaries
  ```
  See `references/greenfield-scaffolding.md` §11 for the matching `Revenue_12W_Rolling` pattern that uses `WeekStart` as the anchor.
- **Greenfield PBIP without PBI Desktop / TE / MCP**: hand-author the model + mock data + theme + report stub, then open in PBI Desktop once. End-to-end recipe (directory layout, M partition paths, theme JSON with 涨红跌绿, mock CSV generator, .gitignore, TBD handling) lives in `references/greenfield-scaffolding.md`. This is the only supported "build from zero without any tool" workflow.
- **`WoW %` under a `week_slicer` single-week filter context is the classic 1-day-vs-full-week trap.** `DATEADD('Date'[Date], -7, DAY)` operates on whatever dates the filter context has narrowed to (the selected week's 7 days), so it returns exactly the day one week before the latest date in that week — a 1-day compare, not a full previous week. **Correct pattern** for "vs previous complete week" when slicer is on a WeekKey:
  ```dax
  VAR CurrentWeekStart = MAX ( 'Date'[WeekStart] )
  VAR PrevWeekStart   = CurrentWeekStart - 7
  VAR PrevWeekEnd     = CurrentWeekStart - 1
  VAR PrevRevenue     = CALCULATE ( [Revenue], DATESBETWEEN ( 'Date'[Date], PrevWeekStart, PrevWeekEnd ) )
  RETURN DIVIDE ( [Revenue] - PrevRevenue, PrevRevenue, BLANK() )
  ```
  Always lock the window with `DATESBETWEEN` and an explicit `[Start, End]` range, never with `DATEADD` against a sliced date column.
- **Slicer-anchored rolling window (e.g. `近 N 周`) must read the slicer explicitly and `REMOVEFILTERS` the date dimension.** `DATESINPERIOD(MAX('Date'[Date]), -N, DAY)` is wrong: any cross-filter from another visual (e.g. `channel_bar` highlight) overrides `MAX('Date'[Date])` and silently shrinks the window. **Correct pattern**:
  ```dax
  VAR AnchorWeekStart =
      COALESCE ( SELECTEDVALUE ( 'Date'[WeekStart] ), MAX ( 'Date'[WeekStart] ) )
  VAR AnchorDate = AnchorWeekStart + 6
  VAR WindowStart = AnchorDate - N * 7 + 1
  VAR WindowEnd   = AnchorDate
  RETURN
      CALCULATE (
          [Revenue],
          REMOVEFILTERS ( 'Date' ),
          DATESBETWEEN ( 'Date'[Date], WindowStart, WindowEnd )
      )
  ```
  Three guarantees: `SELECTEDVALUE` reads the slicer explicitly (not the side-effected `MAX`), `COALESCE` falls back to the latest week when the slicer is empty (e.g. after "Clear filters"), and `REMOVEFILTERS('Date')` neutralizes any cross-filter that would otherwise distort the window. Pair this with `sortByColumn: WeekStart` on the slicer field — see the cross-year rule above.

## TMDL File Types

| File | Contents | Location |
|------|----------|----------|
| `model.tmdl` | Model configuration, `ref table` entries, query groups, annotations | `definition/` |
| `model.tmdl` | Model configuration, `ref table` entries, query groups, annotations | `definition/` (PBI Desktop default) or `<Name>.SemanticModel/` root (PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` resolves `./model` relative to the folder path you pass; placing it at the SemanticModel root avoids confusion). |
| `database.tmdl` | Compatibility level, model ID | `definition/` |
| `relationships.tmdl` | All relationships between tables | `definition/` |
| `expressions.tmdl` | Shared M expressions and parameters | `definition/` |
| `functions.tmdl` | DAX user-defined functions (reusable parameterized DAX) | `definition/` |
| `roles/<RoleName>.tmdl` | One file per security role (RLS filters, role members, OLS) | `definition/roles/` |
| `perspectives/<Name>.tmdl` | One file per perspective (object membership) | `definition/perspectives/` |
| `dataSources.tmdl` | Legacy data source definitions (if present) | `definition/` |
| `tables/<Name>.tmdl` | Table definition with columns, measures, hierarchies, partitions | `definition/tables/` |
| `cultures/<locale>.tmdl` | Linguistic metadata and translations | `definition/cultures/` |

## Object Nesting Rules

Objects must be nested inside their correct parent. The validator enforces these rules:

| Object | Allowed Parent(s) |
|--------|-------------------|
| `column`, `measure`, `hierarchy`, `partition`, `calculationGroup` | `table` |
| `level` | `hierarchy` |
| `calculationItem` | `calculationGroup` |
| `tablePermission` | `role` |
| `columnPermission` | `tablePermission` |
| `perspectiveTable` | `perspective` |
| `perspectiveColumn`, `perspectiveMeasure`, `perspectiveHierarchy` | `perspectiveTable` |
| `linguisticMetadata`, `translation` | `cultureInfo` |
| `dataAccessOptions` | `model` |
| `formatStringDefinition` | `measure`, `calculationItem` |
| `detailRowsDefinition` | `measure`, `table` |
| `alternateOf` | `column` |
| `member` | `role` |
| `annotation`, `extendedProperty` | any object (including `queryGroup`, `function`, `member`) |
| `ref` | `model`, `table` |

Root-level objects (indent 0 only): `model`, `database`, `table`, `relationship`, `role`, `cultureInfo`, `perspective`, `dataSource`, `expression`, `queryGroup`, `function`.

## Syntax Rules

### Indentation

TMDL uses **whitespace indentation** where depth equals nesting level. PBIP files use a single tab per level (the TOM `TmdlSerializer` default), so all examples below use tabs:

```tmdl
table Product                              // depth 0: top-level declaration
	lineageTag: abc-123                    // depth 1: table property

	measure '# Products' =                // depth 1: measure declaration
			COUNTROWS (                    // depth 3: DAX expression body (one deeper than properties)
			    VALUES ( Product[Name] )   // depth 3: continued
			)                              // depth 3: continued
		formatString: #,##0               // depth 2: measure property
		displayFolder: Measures            // depth 2: measure property
		lineageTag: def-456               // depth 2: measure property

	column 'Product Name'                  // depth 1: column declaration
		dataType: string                   // depth 2: column property
		lineageTag: ghi-789               // depth 2: column property
		summarizeBy: none                  // depth 2: column property
		sourceColumn: Product Name         // depth 2: column property

		annotation SummarizationSetBy = Automatic  // depth 2: column annotation
```

**Key rules:**
- Use tabs in PBIP files (Power BI Desktop's default); see the Critical section above for the spaces alternative
- Table-level objects (columns, measures, hierarchies, partitions) are at depth 1
- Properties of those objects are at depth 2
- Multi-line DAX expression bodies are always **2 levels deeper than the enclosing declaration** (depth 3 for measures/columns inside a table; depth 2 for top-level functions; depth 4 for calculationItems)
- Annotations are at the same depth as properties of their parent object, separated by a blank line

### Descriptions (`///`)

Triple-slash sets the `Description` property on the **next** declaration. This is native TMDL syntax (not a Tabular Editor extension); the TMDL spec treats `///` as first-class description support.

```tmdl
/// Count of distinct products in the current filter context.
measure '# Products' =
		COUNTROWS ( VALUES ( Product[Product Name] ) )
	formatString: #,##0
	lineageTag: abc-123
```

**Rules:**
- `///` must be immediately followed by a declaration on the next line
- No blank line between `///` and the declaration
- Multiple `///` lines concatenate into a single description
- `///` applies to the next `measure`, `column`, `table`, `hierarchy`, or `level`

**Common mistake:**
```tmdl
// WRONG: blank line between /// and declaration
/// This is a description.

measure 'My Measure' = 1

// WRONG: /// used as a separator comment
///
measure 'My Measure' = 1

// RIGHT: /// immediately before declaration
/// This is a description.
measure 'My Measure' = 1

// RIGHT: // used for regular comments
// This is just a comment, not a description.
measure 'My Measure' = 1
```

### Comments (`//`)

Double-slash is a regular comment with no semantic effect:

```tmdl
// This is a comment — it does not set any property
measure 'My Measure' = 1
```

### Property Ordering

Properties should follow a consistent order, though TMDL is not strict about it. The conventional order is:

**For columns:** `dataType`, `isHidden`, `isKey`, `displayFolder`, `lineageTag`, `summarizeBy`, `isNameInferred`, `sourceColumn`, `sortByColumn`, then annotations.

**For measures:** DAX expression (on the `=` line or multi-line), `formatString` or `formatStringDefinition`, `displayFolder`, `lineageTag`, then annotations.

## Name Quoting

### When to Quote

Use single quotes around names that contain any of these characters:
- Spaces: `'Product Name'`
- Dots: `'Sales.Amount'`
- Equals: `'Price = Target'`
- Colons: `'Date:Key'`
- Single quotes (escape by doubling): `'Customer''s Name'`
- Other special characters: `'Sales ($)'`, `'OTD % (Value)'`, `'1) Selected Metric'`
- Names starting with a digit: `'4) Selected Period'`

### When NOT to Quote

Do not quote names that are simple identifiers:
- `Product` (simple word)
- `_Measures` (underscore prefix, no spaces)
- `Date` (simple word)
- `CgMetricQuantity` (PascalCase, no spaces)

### Examples

```tmdl
table Product                    // unquoted: simple name
table _Measures                  // unquoted: underscore prefix
table 'Budget Rate'              // quoted: contains space
table 'Invoice Document Type'    // quoted: contains spaces
table '1) Selected Metric'       // quoted: starts with digit
table 'On-Time Delivery'         // quoted: contains space
```

## Column Definitions

For complete column examples (basic, hidden, key, sortByColumn, description), see **`references/tmdl-file-examples.md`**. For full property reference, see **`references/column-properties.md`**.

Key column pattern:

```tmdl
column 'Product Name'
	dataType: string
	displayFolder: 1. Product Hierarchy
	lineageTag: abc-123
	summarizeBy: none
	sourceColumn: Product Name

	annotation SummarizationSetBy = Automatic
```

## Measure Definitions

### Single-Line DAX

```tmdl
measure '# Products' = COUNTROWS ( VALUES ( Product[Product Name] ) )
	formatString: #,##0
	displayFolder: Measures
	lineageTag: abc-123
```

### Multi-Line DAX

Two syntaxes for multi-line DAX:

**1. Indented block** (most common) -- expression body indented two levels deeper than the declaration:

**2. Triple-backtick block** -- DAX enclosed in `` ``` `` fences, useful for expressions with complex indentation:

```tmdl
measure Percentage = ```
		VAR _Total = CALCULATE( SUM ( 'Table'[Quantitative] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( ) )
		RETURN
		DIVIDE ( SUM ( 'Table'[Quantitative] ), _Total )
		```
	formatString: 0.0%;-0.0%;0.0%
	lineageTag: abc-123
```

**Indented block syntax** (standard approach) -- indented two extra tabs from the measure's parent (table) level:

```tmdl
measure 'Actuals MTD' =
		CALCULATE (
		    [Actuals],
		    CALCULATETABLE (
		        DATESMTD ( 'Date'[Date] ),
		        'Date'[IsDateInScope]
		    )
		)
	formatString: #,##0
	displayFolder: 2. MTD\Actuals
	lineageTag: abc-123
```

### Measure with Description

```tmdl
/// Number of workdays elapsed month-to-date, considering only dates in scope.
measure '# Workdays MTD' =
		CALCULATE(
		    MAX( 'Date'[Workdays MTD] ),
		    'Date'[IsDateInScope] = TRUE
		)
	formatString: #,##0
	displayFolder: 5. Weekday / Workday\Measures\# Workdays
	lineageTag: abc-123
```

### Measure with formatStringDefinition (Dynamic Format)

```tmdl
measure 'Sales Target MTD vs. Actuals (%)' =
		Comparison.RelativeToTarget (
		    [Actuals MTD],
		    [Sales Target MTD]
		)
	displayFolder: 2. MTD\Sales Target
	lineageTag: abc-123

	formatStringDefinition =
			FormatString.Comparison.RelativeToTarget (
			    "SUFFIX",
			    1,
			    "ARROWS",
			    "",
			    ""
			)
```

**Note:** `formatStringDefinition` replaces `formatString` when the format is computed dynamically via a DAX expression (often a calculation group format function).

## Other Object Types

For complete examples of calculated columns, roles (RLS/OLS), calculation groups, date table marking, hierarchies, partitions, relationships, shared expressions, and model configuration, see **`references/tmdl-file-examples.md`**.


## Common Data Quality Patterns

### summarizeBy Rules

| Column Type | Correct `summarizeBy` | Reason |
|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| Keys (surrogate/natural) | `none` | Keys are never aggregated |
| Attributes (names, codes, types) | `none` | Text attributes are never summed |
| Dates | `none` | Dates are never summed |
| Boolean flags | `none` | Flags are never summed |
| Additive numeric facts (amounts, quantities) | `sum` | Default aggregation is SUM |
| Non-additive numeric facts (rates, percentages) | `none` | Cannot be meaningfully summed |

**Common fix pattern** — changing `summarizeBy: sum` to `summarizeBy: none` for key columns:

```tmdl
// Before (wrong - key column should not sum)
column 'Customer Key'
	dataType: int64
	isHidden
	lineageTag: abc-123
	summarizeBy: sum
	sourceColumn: Customer Key

// After (correct)
column 'Customer Key'
	dataType: int64
	isHidden
	lineageTag: abc-123
	summarizeBy: none
	sourceColumn: Customer Key
```

### formatString Patterns

| Data Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Integer | `#,##0` | 1,234 |
| Decimal (2 places) | `#,##0.00` | 1,234.56 |
| Percentage | `#,##0%` or `0.00%` | 85% or 85.00% |
| Currency | `$#,##0.00` | $1,234.56 |
| Date | `mm/dd/yyyy` or `dd/mm/yyyy` | 01/15/2024 |

### PBI_FormatHint Annotation

Power BI Desktop may add a `PBI_FormatHint` annotation alongside `formatString`:

```tmdl
column Amount
	dataType: decimal
	formatString: #,##0.00
	lineageTag: abc-123
	summarizeBy: sum
	sourceColumn: Amount

	annotation SummarizationSetBy = Automatic

	annotation PBI_FormatHint = {"isGeneralNumber":true}
```

**Do not fight this annotation.** Power BI tooling re-adds it automatically. When setting a `formatString`, leave any existing `PBI_FormatHint` in place. If Power BI re-adds a removed `PBI_FormatHint`, accept it.

### Indentation Depth Summary

**Rule: a multi-line DAX body is always 2 levels deeper than its enclosing object declaration.**

| Context | Depth | Tabs |
|---------|-------|------|
| Top-level declaration (`table`, `relationship`, `expression`) | 0 | 0 |
| Table properties, column/measure/hierarchy declarations | 1 | 1 |
| Column/measure properties, hierarchy levels | 2 | 2 |
| DAX body for measure/column declared at depth 1 (inside table) | 3 | 3 |
| Level properties | 3 | 3 |
| DAX body for top-level `function` declared at depth 0 | 2 | 2 |
| `calculationItem` inside `calculationGroup` (depth 1) | 2 | 2 |
| DAX body for `calculationItem` at depth 2 | 4 | 4 |

### Fetching Docs

To retrieve current TMDL reference docs, use `microsoft_docs_search` + `microsoft_docs_fetch` (MCP) if available, otherwise `mslearn search` + `mslearn fetch` (CLI). Search based on the user's request and run multiple searches as needed to ensure sufficient context before proceeding.

### Example Model

- **`examples/SpaceParts.SemanticModel/`** -- Complete real-world TMDL model (SpaceParts) with 40 tables, 152 measures, 8 calculation groups, 8 RLS roles, 2 perspectives, DAX UDFs (functions.tmdl), shared M expressions, relationships, and cultures. Covers every TMDL file type. Key files to study:
  - `definition/functions.tmdl` -- DAX user-defined functions with parameters, types, and multi-line expressions
  - `definition/tables/Z04CG1 - Time Intelligence.tmdl` -- Calculation group with triple-backtick DAX
  - `definition/tables/__Measures.tmdl` -- Measures table with calculation group references
  - `definition/tables/Invoices.tmdl` -- Large fact table (51 measures, 18 columns)
  - `definition/tables/Date.tmdl` -- Calculated date table with 42 columns
  - `definition/roles/Account Managers.tmdl` -- RLS role with DAX filter expression
  - `definition/relationships.tmdl` -- 27 relationships including inactive
  - `definition/expressions.tmdl` -- Shared M/Power Query expressions and parameters
  - `definition/perspectives/Measure Selection.tmdl` -- Perspective definition
