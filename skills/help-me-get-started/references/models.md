# Semantic model tools

For `tabular-editor`, `pbi-desktop`, `pbip` (TMDL), and `semantic-models`. Some of these are Windows-only; on a Mac they run inside a Windows VM (see the Parallels section at the end and in `references/foundation.md`).

## te (Tabular Editor CLI, cross-platform, preview)

The `semantic-models` skills drive every model change through `te` first (add/set measures, relationships, roles, calc groups, `te validate`, `te bpa`, `te vertipaq`, `te query`). It is a single self-contained binary; no runtime to install. The `tabular-editor` plugin owns the install reference.

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$arch = if ($env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE -eq 'ARM64') { 'arm64' } else { 'x64' }
$dir  = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\te"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dir | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest "https://cdn.tabulareditor.com/files/cli/latest/te-win-$arch.zip" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\te.zip"
Expand-Archive -Force "$env:TEMP\te.zip" -DestinationPath $dir
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', "$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User'));$dir", 'User')
& "$dir\te.exe" --version
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
os=$(uname -s | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'); [ "$os" = darwin ] && os=osx
arch=$(uname -m); case "$arch" in arm64|aarch64) arch=arm64 ;; x86_64|amd64) arch=x64 ;; esac
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
curl -fsSL "https://cdn.tabulareditor.com/files/cli/latest/te-$os-$arch.tar.gz" | tar xz -C "$HOME/.local/bin" te
chmod +x "$HOME/.local/bin/te"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to persist
te --version
```

Authenticate with `te auth login` (browser, cached); check `te auth status`. CI or unattended runs use `te --auth env` with `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` / `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `AZURE_TENANT_ID`. Self-update with `te --update`; share a session across calls with `TE_SESSION=<name>`.

Two caveats worth stating up front: cloud deploy/refresh/query needs an XMLA-write-capable SKU (Premium, PPU, Fabric, or Trial); `fab import` is the non-XMLA fallback. And this is a limited public preview whose builds stop working after 2026-09-30, with no license required during preview.

## TabularEditor.exe (TE2, Windows-only)

Free, Windows-only. Used by the `te2-cli` and `c-sharp-scripting` skills for deployment, C# scripting, and BPA in existing Windows pipelines.

```powershell
# Windows: download and extract from releases, or use Chocolatey
choco install tabulareditor2
```

Releases: [github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases). There is no native macOS build; on a Mac, run it inside a Windows VM. Auth uses Windows integrated auth by default, or a service principal via the same `AZURE_*` env vars, or an MSOLAP connection string.

## Power BI Desktop (Windows-only)

Required by the whole `pbi-desktop` plugin (connect to a live local model) and the local paths of `pbir` and `semantic-models`.

```powershell
# Windows: winget or the Microsoft Store
winget install Microsoft.PowerBI
```

There is no macOS build; on a Mac it runs inside a Windows VM. For the Desktop Bridge and `pbir desktop` features, enable the preview feature "Enable external tool access to Power BI Desktop through secure local APIs" (File > Options > Preview features), then restart Desktop. DAX UDF / daxlib work upgrades the model compatibility level to 1702+, which is irreversible.

## PowerShell + TOM/ADOMD.NET (the connect-pbid stack)

This stack is a fallback, not a default. The `connect-pbid` skill talks to Power BI Desktop's local Analysis Services instance over the Tabular Object Model (TOM) and ADOMD.NET, from PowerShell. In the model-change cascade it sits third: `te` CLI, then a Power BI Modeling MCP, then this live TOM path, and only then hand-authored TMDL. Install it when you need the local read/trace path, or to make a change when no CLI or MCP is available.

Directly modifying model metadata is not recommended as a habit; prefer the validated tools higher in the cascade. TOM is at least a structured API against the live model, which is why it outranks hand-editing TMDL (raw text surgery, the easiest way to leave the model inconsistent). Whichever fallback you use, capture the result back to source afterward.

The whole stack is Windows (native, or in a Mac's Windows VM).

PowerShell 7, if you want it alongside Windows PowerShell:

```bash
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell     # Windows
brew install powershell                 # macOS (formula; the connect-pbid path still needs the VM)
```

NuGet CLI, then the TOM and ADOMD.NET packages:

```powershell
# Windows: NuGet CLI
winget install Microsoft.NuGet

# Install both packages once (idempotent; DLLs land under lib\net45\)
$pkgDir = "$env:TEMP\tom_nuget"
nuget install Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64 -OutputDirectory $pkgDir -ExcludeVersion
nuget install Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient.retail.amd64 -OutputDirectory $pkgDir -ExcludeVersion
```

Load the DLLs with `Add-Type -Path`. The connection is `localhost:<port>` only (no auth); the skill discovers the port from `msmdsrv.exe`. If a TOM type is missing (for example `TmdlSerializer`), the `.retail.amd64` package is too old; the newer `Microsoft.AnalysisServices` package (.NET 8+) has current types.

## .NET 8 SDK (for daxlib model operations)

The `daxlib` model operations in `connect-pbid` run a small .NET 8 console project (`daxlib-tom`), so add/update/remove/installed need the .NET 8 SDK. Read-only daxlib browsing does not.

```bash
# Windows
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8

# macOS (cask; note that daxlib model ops still route through the Windows VM)
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```

Verify: `dotnet --version` (expect 8.x). Official downloads: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

## daxlib (bundled)

The `daxlib` CLI is a bundled bash script in the plugin (`plugins/pbi-desktop/skills/connect-pbid/daxlib.sh`); nothing to install. It browses and installs DAX UDF packages from [daxlib.org](https://daxlib.org). Its prerequisites are `jq`, `bash` 3.2+, optionally `gh` (registry browsing, else `curl`), the .NET 8 SDK for model ops, and Power BI Desktop open.

## tmdl-validate (bundled)

The `pbip` plugin's TMDL syntax hook uses a prebuilt Rust binary that ships in `plugins/pbip/hooks/bin/` (per-OS variants for macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, Windows x64). No install. It is unsigned, so Windows Defender or corporate AV may false-positive; whitelist it, or disable the check with `tmdl_syntax: false` in the hook `config.yaml`. It is a stopgap slated for replacement by `te validate`.

## Mac: running the Windows-only stack in a VM

Power BI Desktop, TE2, NuGet, and the TOM/ADOMD.NET PowerShell path have no macOS builds. On a Mac, the `pbi-desktop` plugin runs them inside a Windows VM through Parallels Desktop and `prlctl`. Expectations:

```
prlctl at /usr/local/bin/prlctl        install Parallels Desktop CLI tools
a licensed Windows VM                   with Power BI Desktop installed and open
shared folders enabled                  so macOS ~ maps to \\Mac\Home\ in the VM
identify the VM                         prlctl list --all  (override with DAXLIB_VM)
generous Bash timeouts                  120000-180000 ms; VM round-trips are slow
```

The skills wrap Windows commands as `prlctl exec <VM> ...` automatically once the VM is detected. Everything cloud-facing (`te`, `fab`, `az`) still runs natively on the Mac; only the local-Desktop stack needs the VM.
