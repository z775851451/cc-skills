# PBIP Project Format

PBIP (Power BI Project) is the developer-mode file format for Power BI. It decomposes a `.pbix` binary into human-readable text files organized in folders, enabling source control, external editing, and multi-author collaboration.

## General, critical guidance

- **This skill covers project structure, not report editing.** Use `te` for the semantic model and
  `pbir` for every report mutation. Never hand-edit PBIR JSON.
- **PBIX is a black box; PBIP is transparent.** PBIX is a single binary that cannot be diffed or edited externally. PBIP splits the same content into text files. Convert between them with File > Save As in PBI Desktop.
- **Thick vs thin reports:** A thick report bundles `.Report/` + `.SemanticModel/` in the same project (`definition.pbir` uses `byPath`). A thin report has `.Report/` only, connecting to a remote model via `byConnection`. Thin reports are preferred for managed/shared BI.
- **A project can contain multiple items.** Multiple `.Report/` and `.SemanticModel/` folders can coexist. The `.pbip` file is optional -- open `definition.pbir` directly.
- **UTF-8 without BOM.** All files must be saved as UTF-8 without BOM. A BOM prefix causes parse errors in some tools.
- **Git line endings:** PBI Desktop writes CRLF. Configure `core.autocrlf` or `* text=auto` in `.gitattributes` to normalize.
- **260-char Windows path limit.** Use short root paths. Deep nesting of page/visual GUIDs can exceed this limit.
- **Desktop reload is selective.** Use `pbir desktop refresh` for supported report/model changes;
  close and reopen Desktop for theme changes.
- **Rename cascades are cross-cutting.** Rename model objects with `te mv --save`, then update each
  report with `pbir fields replace` or `replace-table` and validate both sides.
- **SparklineData metadata** selectors embed Entity references in compact strings that do not follow the standard `SourceRef.Entity` JSON structure. Easy to miss.
- **DAX query files exist in TWO locations:** `<Name>.SemanticModel/DAXQueries/` and `<Name>.Report/DAXQueries/`. Always check both during renames.
- **`git status --short` and "clean working tree" are not the same thing.** `??` markers mean **untracked** (never added, never committed). "干净工作区" = no untracked + no unstaged + no staged, i.e. `git status --porcelain` is empty AFTER `git add` + `git commit`. If a PM/work bot says "git status 干净" and you see `??` lines, point it out — they likely meant "no in-progress modifications to committed files" but the repo has no commits yet. Don't silently `add`/`commit` to "fix" it; the user owns commit decisions and may want a review gate.
- **UAT gates in greenfield PBIP delivery — what counts as evidence by layer:**
  - **Data layer (DAX measure math):** Reproduce the measure in pandas (or SQL) against the same mock CSV. Pass = numbers match within rounding. This is hard evidence and is the only layer you can verify without PBI Desktop.
  - **TMDL syntax layer:** Use PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` against the `.SemanticModel/` folder. Its parser reports the exact unsupported property and line number — use that as the diagnostic. If MCP is offline, hand-validate against the rules in the `tmdl` skill (no `createOrReplace` wrappers, no `ref defaultMeasure` in `database.tmdl`, use annotations for date-table marking, M expressions in triple backticks).
  - **Visual layer (theme, slicer behavior, conditional formatting, anchor highlighting):** Requires PBI Desktop + screenshots. If Desktop is not installed, mark visual UAT as "未执行" — do NOT claim "通过" based on math layer alone. The user/PM gets to decide whether math-layer evidence is sufficient for commit.
  - **Fail-loud rule:** When a layer can't be verified, say so explicitly. Never substitute "looks right" for "verified."

- **UAT status must be three-state, never binary.** Each verification layer reports exactly one of:
  - `通过` — tool returned a positive result (MCP parse OK, Desktop screenshot matches contract, mock numbers reconcile to DAX).
  - `失败（无法验证）` — the required tool was unreachable / offline / not installed, so no verdict is possible. State the blocking reason (e.g. "MCP disconnected", "no Windows host for PBID").
  - `未执行` — task not started or the environment doesn't support it (e.g. visual UAT on a host without PBI Desktop).
  - **Forbidden: claiming `通过` based on adjacent-layer evidence.** Math-layer pass does NOT imply TMDL-syntax pass. A static lint script that happens to return 36/36 on a self-authored checklist does NOT replace a real parser — say so.
  - **Forbidden: "looks right, committing."** When a tool is offline, do not paper over the gap with proxy evidence; report `失败（无法验证）` and surface the decision to the user/PM.

- **MCP unreachability protocol.** PBI Modeling MCP `ConnectFolder` is the canonical TMDL syntax validator, but it can become "unreachable after N consecutive failures" mid-session and stay offline for minutes-to-hours. When that happens:
  1. Stop retrying beyond the user's stated retry budget (default: 1 retry). The MCP error message itself is the signal — it says "Auto-retry available in ~Ns" and "Do NOT retry this tool yet".
  2. Fall back to a hand-rolled static check (see `tmdl` skill Critical rules: `database.tmdl` does not accept `ref table` / `createOrReplace` / `ref defaultMeasure`; per-table files start with `table <Name>`; M expressions use triple backticks; date marking via annotations not `dataCategory:`; relationships use singular `relationship`).
  3. Report both: the MCP failure and the static-check result. Frame the static check as "internal, no real parser verdict" — not as a pass.
  4. Surface the unresolved UAT to the user/PM with the concrete next action (install PBI Desktop, run on Windows, wait for MCP). Do not commit a model whose syntax layer is `失败（无法验证）` — the user owns commit decisions.

- **Commit discipline in greenfield PBIP.** Never `git add` / `git commit` without explicit user approval. `git status` showing `??` (untracked) is the default state of a freshly-init'd repo and is NOT "干净工作区". Two checks before claiming "ready to commit":
  - `git status --porcelain` returns empty (no untracked, no unstaged, no staged).
  - User has explicitly said commit / merge / ship.
  If the PM/work bot says "git status 干净" and you see `??` lines, correct them on the spot — they likely meant "no in-progress modifications to committed files" but the repo has zero commits. Do not silently add to "fix" it.

## Working with PBIX Files

Treat PBIX as an opaque Desktop artifact. Do not unzip it, patch its internals, reconstruct PBIR from
its contents, or invoke an unapproved extraction engine. Microsoft licensing/EULA questions around
third-party engine redistribution are unresolved for this project.

Use Power BI Desktop **File > Save As > Power BI Project (.pbip)**, then work on the resulting
`.Report` folder with `pbir` and on the semantic model with `te`. If Desktop conversion is not
available, stop and ask for a PBIP/PBIR source artifact rather than inventing a conversion path.
## PBIX vs PBIP

| Aspect | PBIX | PBIP |
|--------|------|------|
| Format | Single binary file | Folder of text files |
| Source control | Not diff-friendly | Git-ready, human-readable diffs |
| Collaboration | Single author at a time | Multiple authors, merge-friendly |
| External editing | Not supported | VS Code, Tabular Editor, scripts |
| Deployment | File > Publish | Git integration, Fabric APIs, fabric-cicd |
| Data | Contains cached data | `cache.abf` is gitignored; metadata only in Git |
| Convert | File > Save As > PBIP | File > Save As > PBIX |

## Project Structure

The `.Report/` folder is required in a PBIP. The `.SemanticModel/` folder is optional — a thin report has only `.Report/` and points at a remote semantic model via `definition.pbir` `byConnection`.

The `.pbi/` subfolders in both items (`localSettings.json`, `editorSettings.json`, `cache.abf`, etc.) are **all optional** — they are per-user/per-machine runtime state generated by Power BI Desktop. A freshly authored PBIP from an external tool may not have any of them, and the project still opens fine in Desktop.

```

## Page folder naming

Power BI Desktop uses opaque 20-character hex slugs for new page, visual, bookmark, and filter folders by default (e.g. `847663d71e27e0840063`). Per Microsoft docs, these can be **renamed to friendly names** but the replacement must satisfy:

- **Regex:** `^[\w-]+$` — word characters (letters, digits, underscore) or hyphen only.
- **No spaces, no dots, no other punctuation.** Names outside this set are **silently ignored** by Power BI Desktop and the page/visual vanishes from the loaded report. This is the hardest bug class to diagnose because there is no error dialog.
- **Folder name and `name` field must match exactly (case-sensitive).** The folder may be bare (`<slug>/`) or suffixed (`<slug>.Page/`) — both forms are valid on disk. pbir-cli uses the `.Page` suffix in its CLI path syntax; current Desktop saves omit the suffix.
- **`pages.json.pageOrder` entries must reference the slug**, not the display name. `activePageName` must be one of the entries in `pageOrder`.
- **Restart Desktop after external rename.** PBI Desktop does not detect file changes while open.

Rename pages with `pbir pages rename`; it owns the cross-report reference updates. Do not rename a
folder or patch the related JSON by hand.

## SharedResources path resolution

Items listed in `resourcePackages[]` are resolved relative to:

```
<Report>/StaticResources/<package_type>/<item.path>
```

For a `SharedResources` package with an item `{ "path": "BaseThemes/Fluent2-CY26SU03.json" }`, Power BI Desktop looks for:

```
<Report>/StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/Fluent2-CY26SU03.json
```

**Missing resource files are a common blocking error.** If `report.json` declares `themeCollection.baseTheme.type = "SharedResources"` and points at a resource that doesn't exist on disk, the report will not open. `validate_pbip.py` checks this explicitly.

## What to Read for Common Tasks

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Convert a PBIX source | **Working with PBIX Files** above -- use Desktop Save As; no extraction |
| Understand entry point file structure | **`references/pbip-file-types.md`** -- `.pbip`, `.pbir`, `.pbism`, `.platform` JSON structure, version properties, byPath vs byConnection |
| Rename a table, measure, or column | `te mv --save`, then `pbir fields replace` or `replace-table`; use the references only to understand validation coverage |
| Fork / duplicate a PBIP project | **`references/pbip-file-types.md`** -- update `.pbip` path, `.pbir` byPath, `.platform` logicalId and displayName |
| Work with Copilot tooling files | **`references/copilot-folder.md`** -- AI instructions, verified answers, schema, example prompts |
| Edit TMDL model files | **`tmdl`** skill -- syntax, authoring, column properties, naming conventions |
| Change a PBIR report | **`pbir-cli`** skill -- all report mutations; `pbir-format` is read-only schema context |
| Verify no broken references after rename | Grep commands below |

## Forking a PBIP Project

1. **Copy the project folder** -- duplicate the entire root folder with a new name.
2. **Rename artifact folders** -- rename `.Report/` and `.SemanticModel/` subfolders to match the new project name.
3. **Rename and update `.pbip`** -- rename the `.pbip` file and update `artifacts[].report.path` to point to the renamed `.Report` folder.
4. **Update `.pbir`** -- if the report uses `byPath`, update the path to point to the renamed `.SemanticModel` folder.
5. **Update `.platform` files** -- set `displayName` to the new project name in each `.platform` file. Regenerate `logicalId` (new GUID) if deploying as a separate Fabric item.

## Verification

Two tools for validation, used together:

1. **`scripts/validate_pbip.py`** — project-level validator for cross-cutting concerns: `.pbip` root file, `.platform` identity, semantic model format (TMDL vs TMSL), `datasetReference` resolution, theme resource resolution on disk, **orphan page folders**, and the **silent-ignore page name regex rule** (page names outside `^[\w-]+$` are silently ignored by Power BI Desktop). Delegates deep `.Report` schema validation to `pbir validate` if it is on PATH.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_pbip.py <path-to-.pbip-or-project>           # validate
   python3 scripts/validate_pbip.py <path> --fix                         # scaffold .gitignore
   python3 scripts/validate_pbip.py <path> --json                        # machine-readable
   python3 scripts/validate_pbip.py <path> --no-pbir-cli                 # skip delegation
   ```

   Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` warnings only, `2` errors, `3` usage error.

2. **`pbir validate <Report.Report>`** (from the `pbir-cli` skill) — canonical JSON schema + PBIR structure validator for the `.Report` folder. Covers JSON syntax, schema compliance, required fields, and optional `--qa` / `--fields` / `--strict` checks.

3. **`pbip-validator`** agent — use for interactive, LLM-driven checking of orphaned references after renames, when you need reasoning over the whole project rather than a deterministic report.

**Known gotcha with `pbir validate`:** if the project's `.pbi/localSettings.json` uses a schema version newer than the one bundled in pbir-cli, `pbir validate` returns `SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED`. Pass `--allow-download-schemas` to let it fetch the missing schema on demand, or ignore `.pbi/` files (they are per-user runtime state and not part of the committed definition).

After any rename or fork operation, verify no old references remain.

```bash
# Search for old name across all project files
grep -r "Old Name" "Project.Report/" "Project.SemanticModel/" --include="*.json" --include="*.tmdl" --include="*.dax"

# Search with word boundaries to avoid partial matches
grep -rP "\bOld Name\b" "Project.Report/" "Project.SemanticModel/"

# Look for old name in single-quoted DAX references
grep -r "'Old Name'" --include="*.tmdl" --include="*.dax"
```

Common missed locations:
1. SparklineData metadata -- compact string format outside standard JSON structure
2. Conditional formatting expressions -- `Entity` refs nested in `Conditional.Cases`
3. Filter config -- page-level and visual-level filters in `filterConfig` sections
4. Sort definitions -- `sortDefinition` blocks in visual JSON
5. DAX queries in Report folder -- the second DAX query location
6. Culture file linguisticMetadata -- `ConceptualEntity` and `ConceptualProperty` inside embedded JSON
