# Power BI Semantic Modeling

Guide users in building optimized, well-documented Power BI semantic models following Microsoft best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users ask about:
- Creating or optimizing Power BI semantic models
- Designing star schemas (dimension/fact tables)
- Writing DAX measures or calculated columns
- Configuring table relationships (cardinality, cross-filter)
- Implementing row-level security (RLS)
- Naming conventions for tables, columns, measures
- Adding descriptions and documentation to models
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Calculation groups and field parameters
- Model validation and best practice checks

**Trigger phrases:** "create a measure", "add relationship", "star schema", "optimize model", "DAX formula", "RLS", "naming convention", "model documentation", "cardinality", "cross-filter"

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Power BI Modeling MCP Server**: Required for connecting to and modifying semantic models
  - Enables: connection_operations, table_operations, measure_operations, relationship_operations, etc.
  - Must be configured and running to interact with models

### Optional Dependencies
- **Microsoft Learn MCP Server**: Recommended for researching latest best practices
  - Enables: microsoft_docs_search, microsoft_docs_fetch
  - Use for complex scenarios, new features, and official documentation

## Workflow

### 1. Connect and Analyze First

Before providing any modeling guidance, always examine the current model state:

```
1. List connections: connection_operations(operation: "ListConnections")
2. If no connection, check for local instances: connection_operations(operation: "ListLocalInstances")
3. Connect to the model (Desktop or Fabric)
4. Get model overview: model_operations(operation: "Get")
5. List tables: table_operations(operation: "List")
6. List relationships: relationship_operations(operation: "List")
7. List measures: measure_operations(operation: "List")
```

### 2. Evaluate Model Health

After connecting, assess the model against best practices:

- **Star Schema**: Are tables properly classified as dimension or fact?
- **Relationships**: Correct cardinality? Minimal bidirectional filters?
- **Naming**: Human-readable, consistent naming conventions?
- **Documentation**: Do tables, columns, measures have descriptions?
- **Measures**: Explicit measures for key calculations?
- **Hidden Fields**: Are technical columns hidden from report view?

### 3. Provide Targeted Guidance

Based on analysis, guide improvements using references:
- Star schema design: See [STAR-SCHEMA.md](references/STAR-SCHEMA.md)
- Relationship configuration: See [RELATIONSHIPS.md](references/RELATIONSHIPS.md)
- DAX measures and naming: See [MEASURES-DAX.md](references/MEASURES-DAX.md)
- Performance optimization: See [PERFORMANCE.md](references/PERFORMANCE.md)
- Row-level security: See [RLS.md](references/RLS.md)

## Quick Reference: Model Quality Checklist

| Area | Best Practice |
|------|--------------|
| Tables | Clear dimension vs fact classification |
| Naming | Human-readable: `Customer Name` not `CUST_NM` |
| Descriptions | All tables, columns, measures documented |
| Measures | Explicit DAX measures for business metrics |
| Relationships | One-to-many from dimension to fact |
| Cross-filter | Single direction unless specifically needed |
| Hidden fields | Hide technical keys, IDs from report view |
| Date table | Dedicated marked date table |

## MCP Tools Reference

Use these Power BI Modeling MCP operations:

| Operation Category | Key Operations |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `connection_operations` | Connect, ListConnections, ListLocalInstances, ConnectFabric |
| `model_operations` | Get, GetStats, ExportTMDL |
| `table_operations` | List, Get, Create, Update, GetSchema |
| `column_operations` | List, Get, Create, Update (descriptions, hidden, format) |
| `measure_operations` | List, Get, Create, Update, Move |
| `relationship_operations` | List, Get, Create, Update, Activate, Deactivate |
| `dax_query_operations` | Execute, Validate |
| `calculation_group_operations` | List, Create, Update |
| `security_role_operations` | List, Create, Update, GetEffectivePermissions |

## Common Tasks

### Add Measure with Description
```
measure_operations(
  operation: "Create",
  definitions: [{
    name: "Total Sales",
    tableName: "Sales",
    expression: "SUM(Sales[Amount])",
    formatString: "$#,##0",
    description: "Sum of all sales amounts"
  }]
)
```

### Update Column Description
```
column_operations(
  operation: "Update",
  definitions: [{
    tableName: "Customer",
    name: "CustomerKey",
    description: "Unique identifier for customer dimension",
    isHidden: true
  }]
)
```

### Create Relationship
```
relationship_operations(
  operation: "Create",
  definitions: [{
    fromTable: "Sales",
    fromColumn: "CustomerKey",
    toTable: "Customer",
    toColumn: "CustomerKey",
    crossFilteringBehavior: "OneDirection"
  }]
)
```

## When to Use Microsoft Learn MCP

Research current best practices using `microsoft_docs_search` for:
- Latest DAX function documentation
- New Power BI features and capabilities
- Complex modeling scenarios (SCD Type 2, many-to-many)
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security implementation patterns
